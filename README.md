This script was written two years ago for Czech FiveM server 8bit.cz, where I was not paid for it. My _coding style_ has changed since then, so I do not provide support or feedback on the script itself.

You need to have installed [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) and [PolyZone](https://github.com/itismaku/polyzone) on your server, as script rely on these scripts.

⚠️ I am not responsible for any security vulnerabilities or other issues caused by this old script.
